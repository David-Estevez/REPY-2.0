Components release
---------------------------------------------------------
Basic components for making the repy module are finished!
Symmetric printable modules for modular robots can be 
done with the two basic parts: bases and ears.

Both parts are entirely parametric, so you can make a 
module that adapts to your needs (e.g. servo size)


Usage:
---------------------------------------------------------

* Execute the program **HARDWARE**, that will create the openscad files
for the REPY-2.0
